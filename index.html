                I self learned SQL and my employer's application database

                different databases.

                I worked on three projects and in all of them, I managed to
                design and write code for restful APIs. I also have a bit of
                experience with regards to sockets and managing a large incoming
                stream of data.

                I have experience in both Web and Mobile platforms. The

                Facebook and VueJS was created by an Ex-Googler.

          I was born and raised in Dubai and I graduated as a civil engineer
          from University College London. I pivoted my career towards computer
          science after I worked for a startup called MUNCH:ON.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt SQL as an intern and my position morphed into data analyst
          that can wrangle data by querying the database and using python to
          manipulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've learnt Javascript and its associated frameworks,
          which I've used to build 3 projects already in othere startups. I now
          plan to push my limits and solidify my foundations in applying my
          programming skills in Make School.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, I'm very interested in the Internet of Things (IoT). I
          believed that the human experience can be significantly improved if we
          know how to collect data and if we're getting a lot of it, which IoT
          does if you know how to manage and orchastrate your whole application.
